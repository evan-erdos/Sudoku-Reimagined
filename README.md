Developed by Succulent Studios.

How To Play
-----------

The aim of Zendoku is to terraform a zen garden so that water flows from one corner of the board to the the other, 
watering a bonsai tree. The garden can be terraformed in four ways: the terrain can be raised, lowered, or kept level, 
or you may add a spout to the tile. A spout will raise the water to the level of the next tile after it. In addition, 
all tiles may be rotated in order to facilitate water flow. The direction the tile is facing can be determined by
looking at the minimap of the garden, displayed in the top left of the screen. The orientation of the icon representing
each modification will let you know which way the tile is rotated. Along with this, the rotation of each tile is also
represented on the 3D board. 

Furthermore, this is sudoku! In order to properly solve the puzzle, each terraforming modification must be used exactly
once in each row and column.

There is no score, and there is not time limit! Take as long as you like to relax and water your bonsai tree.
